Experimenting with trelliscopejs for creating small multiples of school STEM entry

## Small multiples

[Small multiples](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_multiple) are a visualisation approach that allow us to compare many plots side by side. [trelliscopejs](https://hafen.github.io/trelliscopejs/index.html#embedding_sharing) is an R package that displays interactively your small multiples and puts an interactive wrapper around them, which allows for further filtering and sorting. The package is developed by [Ryan Hafen](http://ryanhafen.com) and [Barret Schloerke](http://schloerke.com).

## Testing trelliscopejs

This repository contains an exploration of trelliscopejs for displaying [STEM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science,_technology,_engineering,_and_mathematics) (Science, Technology, Engineering and maths) entry rates for around 50 schools across three local authorities in England.

## Data

The data are published by the UK government's Department for Education on the [GOV.UK](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/a-level-and-other-16-to-18-results-2015-to-2016-revised) website.
